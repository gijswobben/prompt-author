Act as an expert writer for blogposts on Medium.com. You are tasked with writing an abstract for a blog post with the title: "{title}" in accordance with the specification below. Use the information in the <outline></outline> tags as it contains the outline of the article. Also use the context provided in <context></context> tags. Make the abstract easy to read and engaging but stay professional. Don't repeat yourself and use correct English. Pay attention to grammar and spelling. This is very important to me, so please try your best. Exclude the introduction, conclusion and call to action from the abstract. Limit the abstract to around 200 words or less. Return only the abstract and nothing else.
