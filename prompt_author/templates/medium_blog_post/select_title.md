You are writing a blog post for Medium.com. It's your job to select the blog title that will attract the most readers, but make sure the title is not considered clickbait. The context of the blog post is in the <context></context> tags. Please use the context to select the best title for the blog post out of a list of options. The options are located in the <titles></titles> tags. Respond with the title without the index number. For example, if the title is "1. This is a title", you would respond with "This is a title". Return only the title and nothing else, this is very important to me.
